Begin by creating the layer "SelectableInversion", then adding the image effect to your main camera.

If you select Use Colored Inversion, then the image will approach a user specified color as the inversion approaches 50% instead of the gray that would otherwise be achieved by combining an inverted image with a non inverted image.

Clicking Use Mask Color will use the color of the mask at that pixel for the mid inversion color instead of a constant user defined color

The Clear Color lets you chose what color the Inversion Camera will clear to, you can also think of this as the default inversion value
