# QMath - C++ Mathematics library
QMath is an ever expanding C++ mathematics library. It's current focus is around creating expression tree structures that can then be manipulated and analysed for a plethora of mathematical uses. QMath currently supports the following:
 - Parsing a string into an expression tree
 - Numerical evaluation of the expression tree
 - Differentiation of the expression tree
 - Simplification of expression trees (WIP)

QMath still has a very long way to go, including:

 - Parser input validation
 - Improved tree simplification
 - Numerical integration
 - Complex number support
 - Much much more

If you appreciate QMath and would like to support it, feel free to contribute to its development or simply share it with others
